                        <h3>Is Meticore safe? Are there any side effects?
                        </h3>                                            
                        <ul class="bb-para" style="padding: 0px;">
                            <li>Meticore has been taken by thousands of folks with no reported side
                                effects. The only side effect is having to spend money on new
                                tight-fitting sexy clothing, or cancel your gym membership!</li>
                            <li>And Meticore is a lot safer than starvation diets or hours of high
                                intensity cardio at the gym, because you are restoring your body’s core
                                temperature rather than disrupting it further. Addressing low core
                                temperature is the single most important thing you can do right now for a
                                turbo-charged metabolism and long-lasting results now and into old age. </li>
                            <li>Meticore is safer than your daily multivitamin. It has natural
                                ingredients and they’re extremely high quality, manufactured at an
                                FDA-inspected, state-of-the-art facility, it’s on the latest equipment
                                and then on top of that they’re put through additional third-party
                                inspections and quality control so you can rest assured that Meticore is safe. </li>
                        </ul>

                        </h3>                                            
                        <ul class="bb-para" style="padding: 0px;">
                            <li>When you start Meticore be prepared for some big changes.
                            </li>
                            <li>As your core temperature is addressed and metabolism is boosted, so
                                you can expect stubborn fat to decrease from all over your body. You can
                                expect your skin to glow and feel plump and fresh. Your hair will get
                                silkier and your joints pain will ease.</li>
                            <li>Now, of course, the point is everyone is different. Everyone has
                                slightly different body chemistry, so it’s difficult to say for sure
                                which benefit you might experience first. </li>
                                <li>The best way to find out is to claim your own supply. Grab one of the
                                    three packages below and just give it a shot. With our 60-day
                                    money-back guarantee, you can feel totally safe doing that.</li>

                                        Most folks are surprised because they have no idea how much their
metabolism has been ruining their life. They get Meticore just thinking
they want to break through their weight loss plateau. And all of a
sudden, they have more energy and their sleep improves too!
                                    </li>

                            <li>This is actually really interesting question that I get asked
                                sometimes. The results that we’ve highlighted today are incredible, if
                                you lose weight too fast, I would suggest taking Meticore every second
                                day rather than every day, and always consult with your doctor. Meticore
                                is an extremely powerful remedy.
                            </li>
                            <li>Even with that in mind, we always want to advise you to lose weight
                                at a healthy, steady pace. Now, I know it can be exciting to see results
                                that you’ve been waiting on for so long, and then you want to push
                                yourself harder. But it’s important to maintain a healthy lifestyle in
                                addition to taking Meticore, and that way you’re going to get the best
                                long-term results.</li>

                            <li>As you’ve seen in the studies today, the doctors researching these
                                natural ingredients recommend you take Meticore for at least 90 days to
                                180 days to ensure you reach your desired weight and lock in the
                                results. That’s because if you are over 40 years old and more than 10lbs
                                over weight, Meticore needs enough time to work throughout your entire
                                body to get you back into balance and losing weight.
                            </li>

                                you need to address low core temperature, but I also know that no two
